To start the my-bittorent client, the user must enter:
./my-bittorrent [options] [files]


Description of the different options:

-p|--pretty-print-torrent-file <.torrent file> : print the torrent file in the
standard output as JSON format.

-m|--mktorrent <path> : use the given path to generate a <path>.torrent file
that corresponds to a valid metainfo file serving <path>.

-c|--check-integrity <.torrent file> : check if the .torrent file is valid in
the current working directory.

-d|--dump-peers <.torrent file> : contact the tracker related to the given
.torrent file and print the peers returned by the tracker, one per line.

-v|--verbose <.torrent file> : log all the network communications with the
peers that have the files written in the .torrent file

-s|--seed <.torrent file> : seed the torrent indefinitely once the download
is finished.

-h|--help : list all the options available for the my-bittorrent binary.



All the options must be used alone except for the "-v" and "-d" which can be
combined with any other option.
